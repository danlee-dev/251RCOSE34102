* Algorithm Analysis:
 - Minimum Average Waiting Time (General): FCFS (0.60)
 - Minimum Average Turnaround Time (General): FCFS (4.80)
 - Maximum CPU Utilization: EDF (98.89%)
 - Maximum Throughput: FCFS (26.3158)

* Real-Time Scheduling Analysis:
 - EDF Deadline Misses: 0
 - RMS Deadline Misses: 15
 - EDF performed better with fewer deadline misses

* Conclusion:
 - For interactive systems: FCFS is ideal (lowest wait time: 0.60 ms)
 - For batch processing: FCFS performs best (lowest turnaround: 4.80 ms)
 - For maximum resource utilization: EDF (98.89% CPU utilization)
 - For real-time systems: Choose based on deadline miss requirements
