* Algorithm Analysis:
 - Minimum Average Waiting Time: Non-Preemptive SJF (11.20)
 - Minimum Average Turnaround Time: Non-Preemptive SJF (17.90)
 - Maximum CPU Utilization: FCFS (96.15%)
 - Maximum Throughput: FCFS (19.2308)


* Conclusion:
 - For interactive systems where quick user response is critical, Non-Preemptive SJF is ideal due to its low average waiting time of 11.20 ms.
 - For time-sensitive applications requiring fast task completion, Non-Preemptive SJF performs best with the lowest turnaround time of 17.90 ms.
 - For real-time systems that demand high CPU utilization, FCFS is most suitable with a utilization of 96.15%.
 - For batch systems where throughput is important, FCFS would be most appropriate with a throughput of 19.2308.
