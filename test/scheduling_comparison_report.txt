* Algorithm Analysis:
 - Minimum Average Waiting Time: Non-Preemptive SJF (9.40)
 - Minimum Average Turnaround Time: Non-Preemptive SJF (15.40)
 - Maximum CPU Utilization: FCFS (93.75%)
 - Maximum Throughput: FCFS (15.6250)


* Conclusion:
 - For interactive systems where quick user response is critical, Non-Preemptive SJF is ideal due to its low average waiting time of 9.40 ms.
 - For time-sensitive applications requiring fast task completion, Non-Preemptive SJF performs best with the lowest turnaround time of 15.40 ms.
 - For real-time systems that demand high CPU utilization, FCFS is most suitable with a utilization of 93.75%.
 - For batch systems where throughput is important, FCFS would be most appropriate with a throughput of 15.6250.
